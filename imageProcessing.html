        <h1 class="course-title">Image Processing</h1>
        <h3 class="title">1. All about Image Processing</h3>
        <div class="information">- The field of image processing involves the use of computer algorithms to process
            images
            for analysis. Image analysis and image enhancement have many use cases in a variety of areas, including
            criminal justice, drug discovery and healthcare, and the military. Computer vision has transformed the way
            we pursue digital image processing. </div><br />
        <div class="information">- We have the capability to find useful information through image segmentation and
            contrast enhancement down to a pixel. We've also expanded our image acquisition capabilities. Where we once
            relied on x-rays in healthcare, for example, we now have digital photographic capabilities for full
            exploration. With a variety of image formats and the ability to work with multiple digital signals, our
            understanding of image processing has evolved.</div>
        <h3 class="title">2. What you will learn through the course</h3>
        <br />
        <div class="grid-container">

            <div class="grid-item">OpenCV</div>

        </div> <br />
        <div class="information">- In this course, you will learn to process, transform, and manipulate images at your
            will, even when they come in thousands. You will also learn to restore damaged images, perform noise
            reduction, smart-resize images, count the number of dots on a dice, apply facial detection, and much more,
            using scikit-image.</div>
        <h3 class="title">3. What you will have after the course</h3>
        <div class="information">- You will have the course degree and Eglish degree</div>
        <br />
        <div class="information">- You will be able to apply your knowledge to different domains such as machine learning
            and artificial intelligence, machine and robotic vision, space and medical image analysis, retailing, and
            many more. Take the step and dive into the wonderful world that is computer vision!</div>
